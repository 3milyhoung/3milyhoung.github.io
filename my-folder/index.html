    <p class="mt-3">I am a passionate student who wants to create new ideas that are beneficial and inclusive to everyone. I am the Yearbook Photographer at my High School, and I have attended 15+ school spirit/sporting events. I also volunteered as a Teacherâ€™s Assistant at a summer school for two years, garnering 90+ volunteer hours each year. Additionally, I am the founder of nonprofit Dignity in Design, a community that advocates against hostile architecture in urban areas such as New York City. I also have feats in the arts, with a Gold and Silver Scholastic Art Award and a Silver Congressional Art Competition Award.</p>
